                Furthermore, we also collect and use the information you provide to us about yourself:<br/>
                a) When you register in svividoo, we ask you to provide personal data, e.g. your name, your email address, phone number, payment method or credit card information. We will only ever ask you for the data we need as a website provider of tutoring with learning prouposes. Our forms show what kind of data is required for the respective process. We cannot process registration or booking lessons without provision of the required data. Credit card information will be immediately passed on to the respective payment provider. We only store truncated credit card data (e.g. “511111******1111”) for reporting purposes and fraud analysis.<br/>
                We store booking-related data for a period of one year and thereafter keep the information required by trade and tax law for the statutory retention periods (usually two years after the conclusion of the contract).<br/>
                b) We keep your account data as long as you keep up your user account with us. If you decide to delete your account, we delete the associated data. However, potential booking data and related basic data (e.g. your name and address) will be kept as described above.<br/>
                c) If you contact us or our customer support (e.g. by email, telephone or contact form on the website), we use the data you provided (usually your contact information and your inquiry) to respond. We keep your inquiries for a period of one year after answering. To the extent required by trade or tax law, we keep such correspondence for the statutory retention periods (usually six years).
